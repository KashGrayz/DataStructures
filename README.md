# DataStructures

Data structures (collections) exist to efficiently store, organize, and access data. There are many useful collections in Python, with List, Dictionary, Tuple, and Set being among the most popular. When it comes to building a data structure from scratch, Linked List and Binary Search Tree are among the most popular when it comes to technical interviews.
